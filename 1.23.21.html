<p><font color="000000"> ok so i sit down to do something right? 
<br>
<br>
and its like 
. 
<br>
<br>
i want to do something right? 
<br>
<br>
bbut i dont know what 
<br>
<br>
so i try something, 	and then 
<br>
<br>
<br>
q 
i get bored and move on 
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
.*.*.*.*. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
its almost like my mind is in a maze 
<br>
<br>
<br>
and theres a sign that says "start" 
<br>
<br>
and theres an arrow pointing in an unspecified direction 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
but the way that the arrow is pointing to... 
[mental break] 
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 
 
 
[continue] 
			it		just leads to an dead end 

but the thing is i am required to follow all the rules of the maze (maze)) 
   so i am caught 
 <br>
<br>
stuck so to say 
<br>
<br>
 
trapped perhaps 
<br>
<br>
even so far as to say confined or imprisoned 
<br>
<br>
<br>
in an endless loop of signs walls and or doorways 
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
notice i didnt list the door 
 <br>
<br>
that means that doors just dont exist 
 <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
jk ([[[[[[[[[[[[[[[just joking]] 
<br>
<br>
 the door is already open so why would i close it?
